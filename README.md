## Why Trickster?
* Trickster is an Laravel package that makes Laravel Fun.
* Trickster provides tricks that makes coding with Laravel easy.
* With **Trickster** inside your **Laravel framework**, your app will become a **Gambit**. :-P

## Installation
Installing Trickster is easy. Just type the command:
`composer require secrethash/trickster`

## Requirements
* **Laravel 5.x**
* **cURL**
* **PHP 5.4.x**

## Usage
To start using ***Trickster***, you will be needed to set it up first. Follow the below steps to setup **Trickster**:

### 1. Service Provider
You will be needing to add the Trickster Service Provider in your `app.php` which is inside the `config` directory.

* Open `config\app.php`
* Find `'providers'`
* At the last of this array in `Application Service Providers` add `Secrethash\Trickster\TricksterServiceProvider::class,`

### 2. Facade
To use **Trickster** flexibly, you need to add the Facade also. Facade will let you use Trickster directly. All you will need to do is add `use Trickster;` at the head of the controller below namespace and use it by `Trickster::trickName();`

**Lets Add the `Trickster` Facade:**

* Open `config\app.php`
* Find `'aliases'` array.
* At the end of this array, add `'Trickster' => Secrethash\Trickster\Facade\Trickster::class,`

### 3. Configuration
First of all you will need to run the following command in your console:
`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Secrethash\Trickster\TricksterServiceProvider"`
>This command will publish the `trickster.php` configuration file for Trickster to your application default `config` directory.

From `config\trickster.php` you can edit the default configurations.

### 4. Ready, Steady, GO!
***You are almost done. Now what to do when you want to use a Trickster's Trick?***

Here is a sample Controller to show you how to add Trickster and Use it:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

use App\Http\Requests;

use Auth;
use Trickster; // Simply add the Facade

class TricksterDemoController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function index()
    {
        //checking if the user is Authenticated
        if (Auth::check()) {
	        $user = Auth::user();
	        // Grabbing Gravatar
	        $gravatar = Trickster::gravatar($user->email, '200');
	     }
    }

    /**
     * Show the form for creating a new resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function create()
    {
        //
    }

}

```

If you want to use Trickster inside a view file, call the `Trickster` method directly. That is the advantage of Facade.

For example:
`{!! Trickster::bbcode($user->bio) !!}`
or
`{{ Trickster::truncator($blog->desc, '150', '(...summary)') }}`


## Trickster's Tricks

### 1. Truncator

Just call the Trickster and provide it with details of the given parameters.
```php
Trickster::truncator('Supplied text is written here, can also be given in a variable; lets leave it simple.', 30, '(read more...)');
// Output: Supplied text is written here, (read more...)
```

### 2. Email Validator
Email Validator gives you the power of validating the email address by just a simple line of code: 
``` php

With Trickster by your side you will not have to write the validation code again and again. Just mention the Facade of Trickster an the validation function that's it.

```
```php
// Returns
